Consider a box of crayons, where each crayon is one of six colors: red, cyan, green, magenta, blue, and yellow. We want to determine the "average" color of the crayons in the box.

## First stab
We can take each color's proportion of the total and use these six values to represent a point in 6-dimensional space. For example, a box containing one of each color would be represented as $(1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6)$. More specifically:

Let $R,C,G,M,B,Y$ be the counts of red, cyan, green, magenta, blue, and yellow crayons respectively.\
Define the total number of crayons, $T = R+C+G+M+B+Y$\
Then, the average color is represented by the vector $\vec{c}$:

$$
\vec{c} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{R}{T} \\[6pt]
  \frac{C}{T} \\[6pt]
  \frac{G}{T} \\[6pt]
  \frac{M}{T} \\[6pt]
  \frac{B}{T} \\[6pt]
  \frac{Y}{T}
\end{bmatrix}
= \frac{1}{T}
\begin{bmatrix}
  R \\[6pt]
  C \\[6pt]
  G \\[6pt]
  M \\[6pt]
  B \\[6pt]
  Y
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The valid values for this model of our box is, by definition, any normalized vector in 6D space.

## Another stab
The above is a very simple and quite useless model. All we have really done is take a known composition and write it down between a pair of brackets. Also, we are familiar with working with hues in only three dimensions (RGB or CMY), while here we have six (RGB+CMY). Shouldn't some of these hues add to white (or black)?

Say we have three pairs of opposing colors: Red<->Cyan, Green<->Magenta, and Blue<->Yellow. Our crayons have an odd but useful property: crayons that are of "opposite" colors cancel out entirely ("opponent cancellation"). That is, we have color cancellation along opponent axes. Note that we _cannot_ combine or cancel colors otherwise: Red plus green plus blue does not cancel, and green plus blue does not combine into cyan. Still, this will let us refine our model further.

Instead of defining a point in six-dimensional space, we can condense it to three dimensions: Red, Blue, and Green. Each value is constrained to be from 1 (a box of all that color) to -1 (a box of all of the opposite color).

Some examples:
A box containing a single red crayon is, on average, completely red $(1, 0, 0)$.
A box containing two red crayons and one cyan is, on average, 1/3 red $(1/3, 0, 0)$.
A box containing one of each crayon is, on average, no color $(0,0,0)$.

More specifically, we can define the average color under this new model (using the same definitions from the first model):

$$
\vec{c} =
\frac{1}{T}
\begin{bmatrix}
  R - C \\
  G - M \\
  B - Y
\end{bmatrix}
$$

We can also define the six unit directions, representing the six "pure" color makeups (of any crayon count):

$$
\hat{r}=
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\
  0 \\
  0
\end{bmatrix},
\hat{c}=
\begin{bmatrix}
  -1 \\
  0 \\
  0
\end{bmatrix},
\hat{g}=
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  1 \\
  0
\end{bmatrix},
\hat{m}=
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  -1 \\
  0
\end{bmatrix},
\hat{b}=
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  0 \\
  1
\end{bmatrix},
\hat{y}=
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  0 \\
  -1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Note that this vector is no longer normalized in general. The valid range for this vector is the _volume_ bounded by a regular octahedron centered on the origin and with vertices located on the axes one unit from the origin in each direction.

## Stab, stab, stab
We'd like to take crayons out of the box for use, or put them in the box for storage. When we take a crayon out of the box, we can update $\vec{c}$ and $T$ accordingly:

Let $r,c,g,m,b,y$ each be $0$ by default or to be $1$ if the crayon we choose is red, cyan, green, magenta, blue, or yellow, respectively.\
Let $t$ be 1 if we are taking a crayon or $-1$ if we are adding a crayon. Then:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
T' = T-t \\
\displaystyle
\vec{c'} = \frac{1}{T'}
\begin{bmatrix}
  R' - C' \\
  G' - M' \\
  B' - Y'
\end{bmatrix}
= \frac{1}{T-t}
\begin{bmatrix}
  (R - t \cdot r) - (C - t \cdot c) \\
  (G - t \cdot g) - (M - t \cdot m) \\
  (B - t \cdot b) - (Y - t \cdot y)
\end{bmatrix}
\end{array}
$$

Conventional wisdom dictates that we cannot take a crayon of a color if there are not any available in that color. That is, $R,C,G,M,B,Y \ge 0$.

## Cutting corners
How tedious, to have to track all six crayon counts in order to maintain an accurate depiction of the contents of the box. Thankfully, our crayons have another weird property which may prove helpful: opponent pairs of crayons are equivalent to (and can be swapped at will for) any other opponent pair ("opponent pair equivalence"). Consider an empty box:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
T = 0 \\
\vec{c} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  0 \\
  0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{array}
$$

We want a green crayon, but all we have in our possession are a red crayon and a cyan crayon. We can add both crayons to the box. First, add the red crayon:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
T = 1 \\
\vec{c} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\
  0 \\
  0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{array}
$$

Then add the cyan crayon:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
T = 2 \\
\vec{c} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  0 \\
  0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{array}
$$

We got here by adding red and cyan crayons, but this macro-state can be attained with any of the three opponent pairs. Not only that, but under the property of opponent pair equivalence, those three micro-states are equivalent. That means we should be able to pull a green crayon from the box, resulting in a new box content:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
T = 1 \\
\vec{c} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  -1 \\
  0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{array}
$$

The box now contains a single magenta crayon. No matter which color crayon we had taken from the box, the remaining crayon would be the other half of its opponent pair.

With this, we can discard half of the colors we were tracking, but now must ensure we track the total count. This brings us from six degrees of freedom $(R, C, G, M, B, Y)$ to just four $(T, \vec{c}\in\mathbb{R}^3)$.

## Edge cases
It seems that we can now make anything out of anything, but that's not _quite_ true. While our conditions are substantially less strict than previous iterations, there are still some things to note.

As seen in our previous example, we ended up with just a magenta crayon left in the box. This has no wiggle room: We know there is precisely one crayon in the box $(T=1)$ and that all of the crayons in the box are magenta $(\vec{c}\equiv\hat{m})$. Even if we had multiple magenta crayons, we can't pull anything from the box except magenta, because there are no opponent pairs to convert to another.

Thinking back to the regular octahedron bounding the valid values for $\vec{c}$, non-degenerate states (i.e. states with a unique micro-state) exist on the surface of the solid, while any state within the solid is a degenerate state. States consisting of only two colors lie along the edges, and states consisting of only one color lie at the six vertices. The sole exception to this is the trivial state where $T=0$, which is non-degenerate but has $\vec{c}$ explicitly defined as $\vec{0}$.

In general, a state is non-degenerate when its $L^1$ norm is equal to $1$. Any other non-trivial state is degenerate, and all combinations of crayons that produce the same $T$ and $\vec{c}$ are equivalent up to a difference in opponent pairs used in the process to obtain that state.

## Proof by perforation
### Setup
 - The colors a crayon can take are defined as $\mathcal{C}=\\{R,C,G,M,B,Y\\}$.
 - A set of crayons is precisely defined by the counts of each color of crayons, $S\in\mathbb{Z}^6$, and has a state consisting of the total number of crayons $T\in\mathbb{Z}$ and the average color vector $\vec{c}\in[-1,1]^3$.
 - A single crayon of color $c\in\mathcal{C}$ has a net color vector $\vec{v}(c)\in[-1,1]^3$ as follows:

$$
\vec{v}(R)=
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 \\
  0 \\
  0
\end{bmatrix},
\vec{v}(C)=
\begin{bmatrix}
  -1 \\
  0 \\
  0
\end{bmatrix},
\vec{v}(G)=
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  1 \\
  0
\end{bmatrix},
\vec{v}(M)=
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  -1 \\
  0
\end{bmatrix},
\vec{v}(B)=
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  0 \\
  1
\end{bmatrix},
\vec{v}(Y)=
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  0 \\
  -1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

 - A set $S$ has a corresponding multiset $\tilde{S}\in\mathcal{C}^T$.
 - A set of crayons $S$ has a state defined as:
   - $T := \sum\limits_{n \in S}{n} = \|\tilde{S}\|$
   - $\vec{c} := \frac{1}{T}\sum\limits_{c\in\tilde{S}}{\vec{v}(c)}$
 - The net color vector of a set is defined as:
   - $\vec{s} := T\cdot\vec{c} = \sum\limits_{c \in S}{\vec{v}(c)}$
 - Multiple sets $S_i$ can be combined into $C$ as follows:
   - $T_C = \sum\limits_{i}{T_i}$
   - $\vec{c_C} = \frac{1}{\sum\limits_{i}{T_i}}\cdot\sum\limits_{i}{\vec{si}}$
   - $\vec{s_C} = T_c\cdot\vec{c_c} = \sum\limits_{i}{\vec{s_i}}$
 - Define the opponent pairs to be $\\{R,C\\},\\{G,M\\},\\{B,Y\\}$, which each have state $T=2,\vec{c}=\vec{0}$.
 - Define the set $\mathcal{N}\subseteq\mathbb{Z}^6$ to be the additive group of multisets generated by any number of these opponent pairs. That is, we treat a multiset as a 6-tuple of counts for each crayon, and $\mathcal{N}$ is the subspace of multisets that sum to $\vec{c}=\vec{0}$.

### Claim
If two multisets $A,B$ satisfy:
 - $T_A=T_B$ (same total count), and
 - $\vec{c_A}=\vec{c_B}$ (same average vector),

then $Aâˆ’B\in\mathcal{N}$. That is, $A$ and $B$ differ only by adding/removing opponent pairs.

### Proof
Let:
 - $A$ and $B$ be multisets of crayons from $\mathcal{C}$.
 - $T_A=T_B=T$
 - $\vec{c_A}=\vec{c_B}=\vec{c}$

#### Step 1:
Define the total vector sum for each set:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{s_A} = \sum\limits_{c\in A}{\vec{v}(c)} = T_A\cdot\vec{c_A} = T\cdot\vec{c} \\
\vec{s_B} = \sum\limits_{c\in B}{\vec{v}(c)} = T_B\cdot\vec{c_B} = T\cdot\vec{c}
\end{array}
$$

So:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{s_A} = \vec{s_B} \\
\Rightarrow\vec{s_A} - \vec{s_B} = \vec{0}
\end{array}
$$

#### Step 2:
Define the multiset differences $D_1={A}\setminus{B}$ and $D_2={B}\setminus{A}$.

Then:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\vec{s_A} - \vec{s_{D_1}} + \vec{s_{D_2}} = \vec{s_B} \\
\Rightarrow \vec{s_{D_1}}-\vec{s_{D_2}} = \vec{s_A}-\vec{s_B} \\
\Rightarrow \vec{s_{D_1}} - \vec{s_{D_2}} = \vec{0}
\end{array}
$$

That is, the set of crayons that are in $A$ but not $B$ and the set of crayons that are in $B$ but not $A$ balance exactly.

#### Step 3:
For the net vector difference $\vec{s_{D_1}}-\vec{s_{D_2}} = \vec{0}$ to hold, the difference in composition between $A$ and $B$ must lie in $\mathcal{N}$. That is, the difference between the two sets must consist only of adding/removing opponent pairs. And, since $T_A$ and $T_B$ are equal and $D_1$ and $D_2$ are the net changes needed to convert between $A$ and $B$, $T_{D_1}$ and $T_{D_2}$ must also be equal. That is, the number of opponent pairs removed must equal the number added.

Put together, the net difference between $A$ and $B$ consists of a set of additions and subtractions, in equal amounts, of opponent pairs.

## Point taken
Now we know the rules governing our box of magical crayons, as well as how to add and remove crayons and even convert them to other colors. Later, we will see what happens when multiple boxes of crayons hang out near each other.
