- Refactored backend payroll processing logic in PHP and C#, allowing systems to handle 100x more data and enhancing REST API throughput.
- Co-led company-wide effort to eliminate deeply embedded technical debt impacting core software systems. Designed transition plans, release safeguards, and feature enablement strategies that enabled asynchronous rollout.

### Software Engineer

- Built bit-oriented messaging protocols in C and Ada to support secure real-time communication between DoD systems.
- Served as Scrum Master for 2 years, guiding software development activities and coordinating cross-functional teams.

### Software Engineer
**CACI Inc.** 2016-2019
- Maintained critical DoD software written in Java, C++, and Ada and deployed across the globe.
- Enhanced existing interfaces with radar systems to account for new functionality. Performed multiple test events to support stakeholders from other organizations.
