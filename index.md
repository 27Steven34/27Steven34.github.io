# Hi. I'm Steven.

I build sharp systems, write clean code, and study math and science for funsies.

I'm the kind of developer who cares about the **why** as much as the **how**. Currently working on [cool stuff](/projects) and always stretching my brain. If it's tech I don't know, then it's tech I aim to learn. Right now, that entails working with embedding models and various storage platforms. I am also learning quantum computing for at least the third time. I feel like this is the time that it will all make sense, because now 3Blue1Brown is doing a video series on the topic.

### About Me

I'm a builder, thinker, and experienced keypresser.

When I'm not shipping code, I'm probably attempting to ship code, fiddling with code, or rewriting someone else's code to fit my own needs. If none of the above, then you may find me relaxing alongside a crackling gaming PC or suffocating under the weight of my three Australian shepherds.
