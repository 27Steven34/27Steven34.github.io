# About Me

I'm Steven. For those who don't understand what that means: I build tools, systems, and the occasional chaotic-neutral side project.

I've worked with heavy backend logic, lightweight SPAs, and building basic AI models from scratch, and I'm always learning something new--right now, it's RAG pipelines and quantum computing.

Outside of code, I game, study physics and math, and occasionally sleep.
